      <!-- Section 2 -->
      <h2 id="tos-2">2. Services Overview</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Web design and development</li>
        <li>Search engine optimization (SEO)</li>

        <li>WordPress development</li>
        <li>Social media marketing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The specific scope, deliverables, and pricing for each engagement will be outlined in a written proposal signed by both parties.</p>

      <!-- Section 3 -->
      <h2 id="tos-3">3. Proposals and Agreements</h2>
      <p>All work begins only after both parties have agreed to a written proposal. The proposal will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scope of work</li>
        <li>Deliverables</li>
        <li>Timeline</li>
        <li>Pricing and payment terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your written approval of the proposal and payment of the initial deposit (if applicable) constitute a binding agreement between you and DC technolabs.</p>

      <!-- Section 4 -->
      <h2 id="tos-4">4. Pricing and Payments</h2>
      
      <h3>Fixed Pricing</h3>
      <p>We operate on a fixed-price model. The price you see upfront is the price you pay (plus GST, if applicable).</p>
      
      <h3>Payment Schedule</h3>
      <p><strong>One-time projects under ₹1,00,000:</strong> 50% upfront upon signing, 50% upon project completion.</p>
      <p><strong>One-time projects over ₹1,00,000:</strong> 40% upfront upon signing, 30% at midway milestone, 30% upon final delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Monthly retainers:</strong> Billed at the start of each month. First month is due upon contract signing.</p>
      
      <h3>Payment Methods</h3>
      <p>We accept bank transfer, UPI, or credit card. A GST invoice is provided with every payment.</p>
      
      <h3>Late Payments</h3>
      <p>Invoices are due immediately upon receipt unless otherwise specified. Payments more than 7 days overdue may result in a pause or suspension of work until payment is received.</p>

      <!-- Section 5 -->
      <h2 id="tos-5">5. Project Timelines</h2>
      <p>Timelines for project completion are estimates and depend on the timely provision of required materials (content, images, access, feedback) from you. Delays in client feedback or content provision may extend the project timeline. We are not liable for timeline delays caused by client-side dependencies.</p>

      <!-- Section 6 -->
      <h2 id="tos-6">6. Revisions and Changes</h2>
      <p>Each project package includes a specific number of design or content revisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starter packages: 2 revisions</li>
        <li>Professional packages: 3 revisions</li>
        <li>Premium packages: Unlimited revisions during the design phase</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Revisions must be requested within the design approval phase. Once a design phase is approved and development begins, major design changes will be treated as separate change orders with additional fees.</p>

      <!-- Section 7 -->
      <h2 id="tos-7">7. Intellectual Property</h2>
      
      <h3>Client Ownership</h3>
      <p>Upon full payment, you own 100% of the deliverables created for you, including custom website code, logos, content, and designs. We do not claim any ownership of your final deliverables.</p>
      
      <h3>DC technolabs Rights</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to display the work we create for you in our portfolio and marketing materials, with your prior approval. If you do not wish your project to be publicly displayed, let us know in writing.</p>
      
      <h3>Third-Party Assets</h3>
      <p>If your project uses stock photos, fonts, icons, or other third-party assets with limited licenses, those assets are subject to their respective licenses (e.g., fonts from Google Fonts are open source or SIL licensed, stock photos may require subscription renewal).</p>

      <!-- Section 8 -->
      <h2 id="tos-8">8. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>To ensure timely delivery, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide all content, images, login details, and feedback as requested</li>
        <li>Respond to our emails and updates within a reasonable time frame</li>
        <li>Review deliverables (design mockups, site features, SEO reports) when requested</li>
        <li>Ensure that all content provided does not violate copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property laws</li>
        <li>Provide access to third-party accounts (hosting, domain, social media, Google Ads) as needed for project completion</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 9 -->
      <h2 id="tos-9">9. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary or sensitive information shared during the engagement. This obligation survives termination of the agreement. If you require a formal NDA, we are happy to provide one.</p>

      <!-- Section 10 -->
      <h2 id="tos-10">10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>DC technolabs is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of our services. Our total liability for any claim arising from this agreement is limited to the fees you have paid for the specific service in question.</p>
      <p>We do not warrant that our services will meet all your requirements, will be error-free, or will operate without interruption. While we make every reasonable effort to deliver high-quality work, website performance, search rankings, and ad campaign results can be influenced by factors outside our control.</p>

      <!-- Section 11 -->
      <h2 id="tos-11">11. Termination</h2>
      
      <h3>Monthly Services</h3>
      <p>Either party may terminate ongoing monthly services with 30 days written notice. No penalties, refunds, or cancellation fees apply. You will not be charged beyond the final month.</p>
      
      <h3>One-Time Projects</h3>
      <p>You may cancel a one-time project at any time by providing written notice. However, payment for work already completed is non-refundable. You will be billed for any work delivered up to the cancellation point.</p>
      
      <h3>Termination by DC technolabs</h3>
      <p>We reserve the right to terminate our engagement if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engage in abusive, harassing, or illegal behavior toward our team</li>
        <li>Fail to provide critical materials or feedback for an extended period (30+ days)</li>
        <li>Fail to make payments as agreed</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Section 12 -->
      <h2 id="tos-12">12. Refund Policy</h2>
      
      <h3>Before Work Begins</h3>
      <p>If you cancel before we begin work, we will issue a full refund of any payments made.</p>
      
      <h3>After Work Begins (One-Time Projects)</h3>
      <p>Refunds are only available for undelivered milestones. If a project is 50% complete, you are liable for payment of that 50%. Delivered work is non-refundable.</p>
      
      <h3>Monthly Services</h3>
      <p>No partial refunds are given for the current month. You may cancel for the following month with 30 days notice.</p>
      
      <h3>Money-Back Guarantee</h3>
      <p>If you are not satisfied with any completed milestone or delivery, please notify us immediately. We will work with you to revise or correct issues at no additional cost, within the limits of your project's revision allowance.</p>

      <!-- Section 13 -->
      <h2 id="tos-13">13. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Any disputes arising from these terms or our services will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.</p>
