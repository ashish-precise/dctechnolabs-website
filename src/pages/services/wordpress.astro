const faqItems: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Do you use page builders like Elementor?", a: "Only if you specifically want Elementor for easy self-editing. For performance, we prefer custom Gutenberg blocks or hand-coded themes — they're significantly faster and cleaner than page builders. We'll recommend the right approach for your needs." },
  { q: "Can you fix my hacked WordPress site?", a: "Yes. We remove all malware, identify and close the entry point, clean the database, harden security settings, and set up Wordfence monitoring. Most cleanups are done within 24–48 hours." },
  { q: "Why is my WordPress site so slow?", a: "Usually: too many plugins, unoptimized images, no caching, shared hosting, or a bloated theme. We audit all of these and implement WP Rocket, Cloudflare CDN, image optimization, and database cleanup. Sub-3-second loads guaranteed." },
  { q: "Can you migrate my site from Wix / Squarespace?", a: "Yes. We migrate all pages, posts, images, and forms to WordPress while preserving your URLs, meta tags, and SEO value. We set up 301 redirects for any changed URLs so you don't lose Google rankings." },
  { q: "Will I be able to update the site myself?", a: "Yes — that's a core goal of every build. We set up a clean admin panel, configure sensible user roles, and include a training session so your team can update content, add blog posts, and manage basic settings independently." },
  { q: "Do you work with multisite WordPress networks?", a: "Yes. We've built and maintained WordPress multisite networks for businesses with multiple branches or brands. Network setup, sub-site theming, and centralized plugin management are all supported." },
  { q: "Can you build a membership or LMS site on WordPress?", a: "Yes. We build membership sites using MemberPress or Restrict Content Pro, and LMS platforms using LearnDash or TutorLMS. Video courses, quizzes, certificates, and subscriptions are all supported." },
  { q: "What hosting do you recommend for WordPress?", a: "For most Ahmedabad businesses, we recommend Cloudways (DigitalOcean) or WPX Hosting — fast, reliable, and reasonably priced. We handle full server setup, SSL, and CDN configuration as part of the build." },
