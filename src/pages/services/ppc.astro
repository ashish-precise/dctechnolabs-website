  { q: "What's the minimum ad budget I need?", a: "We recommend a minimum monthly ad spend of ₹30,000 for Search campaigns in most Ahmedabad industries. Competitive niches (real estate, healthcare) typically need ₹75,000+ to generate meaningful volume. Our management fee is separate from your ad spend." },
  { q: "Do I own my Google Ads account?", a: "Yes. Always. We work inside your account, not ours. If you ever leave, you take everything with you — campaign history, data, audiences. We don't hold accounts hostage." },
  { q: "What's your management fee?", a: "Our management fees start at ₹35,000/month. This covers strategy, campaign management, optimization, landing pages, and reporting. Ad spend is billed directly to your Google account — we never mark up your media spend." },
  { q: "Can you take over my existing Google Ads account?", a: "Yes. We start with a full account audit, identify where money is being wasted, fix the campaign structure, and typically reduce cost-per-lead by 30–50% within 60 days." },
  { q: "What industries do you specialize in?", a: "Real estate, healthcare, legal, education, e-commerce, SaaS, hospitality, and manufacturing. We have proven campaign templates and landing pages for each vertical that dramatically cut the 'learning curve.'" },
  { q: "How do you track results?", a: "We set up Google Analytics 4, conversion tracking for forms and calls, and a custom reporting dashboard. You see spend, leads, cost-per-lead, and ROAS in real time — not just at end of month." },
  { q: "Do you run Facebook Ads too?", a: "Yes. We manage Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram) as an add-on. For most Ahmedabad businesses, Google Search delivers higher-intent leads, so we recommend starting there." },
