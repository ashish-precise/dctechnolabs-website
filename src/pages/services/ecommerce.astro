const faqItems: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Should I use Shopify or WooCommerce?", a: "Shopify is better for straightforward product stores — faster to launch, easier to manage, and hosted. WooCommerce is better if you need tight WordPress integration, more customization, or want to avoid Shopify's transaction fees. We'll recommend the right fit after understanding your catalog and technical requirements." },
  { q: "Can you migrate my existing store?", a: "Yes. We migrate stores from Wix, Squarespace, Magento, or any other platform — including all products, customer data, order history, and SEO redirects — with zero data loss." },
  { q: "Do you integrate with Indian payment gateways?", a: "Yes. Razorpay, Paytm, PhonePe, BillDesk, CCAvenue, Cashfree — we've integrated them all. We also set up EMI options, UPI QR codes, and COD with automated reconciliation." },
  { q: "Can you connect my store to Amazon / Flipkart?", a: "Yes. We integrate your store inventory with Amazon Seller Central and Flipkart Seller Hub so stock syncs automatically and you don't oversell across channels." },
  { q: "How do you handle GST compliance?", a: "All our stores generate GST-compliant invoices automatically on every order, with correct CGST/SGST/IGST split based on shipping destination. We also integrate with Tally or Zoho Books on request." },
  { q: "Can you build a B2B store with custom pricing?", a: "Yes. Customer-specific pricing, bulk discount tiers, credit terms, purchase order workflows, and GST invoice generation for business buyers — all supported." },
  { q: "How long does an e-commerce build take?", a: "Starter stores: 3–4 weeks. Business stores: 5–7 weeks. Marketplace projects: 10–14 weeks. Timeline depends on catalog size, custom features, and how quickly you provide product content." },
  { q: "Do you provide ongoing store management?", a: "Yes. We offer monthly maintenance plans that include product uploads, banner updates, new feature development, and performance monitoring. Many clients use us as their ongoing e-commerce tech team." },
