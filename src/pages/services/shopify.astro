const faqItems: FaqItem[] = [
  { q: "Should I use Shopify or WooCommerce?", a: "Shopify is better if you want a hosted, reliable platform you don't need to maintain — no servers, no updates, no security patches. WooCommerce is better if you want full code control or are deeply integrated with WordPress. We'll recommend the right platform after understanding your needs." },
  { q: "Can you integrate Razorpay with Shopify?", a: "Yes. We integrate Razorpay, Paytm, PhonePe, UPI, and all major Indian payment gateways with Shopify. This includes EMI options, UPI QR codes, and COD with automated reconciliation." },
  { q: "Can you migrate my WooCommerce store to Shopify?", a: "Yes — products, customers, orders, and SEO all migrate with zero data loss. We set up 301 redirects for all old URLs so you don't lose Google rankings. Most migrations complete in 1–2 weeks." },
  { q: "Do you build custom Shopify themes or use paid themes?", a: "We build custom themes in Shopify Liquid. Paid themes are fast to launch but they're shared by thousands of stores and can't be customized without workarounds. For a brand that wants to stand out, custom is always better." },
  { q: "Can you handle GST on Shopify?", a: "Yes. We configure Shopify's tax settings for Indian GST, connect it to an invoice app (like Sufio or a custom solution), and ensure every order generates a GST-compliant invoice with the correct CGST/SGST/IGST split." },
  { q: "What Shopify apps do you recommend for Indian stores?", a: "Razorpay for payments, Shiprocket for shipping, Instamojo or PayU as backup gateway, Loox or Judge.me for reviews, Klaviyo for email, and custom apps where needed. We configure all of these as part of the build." },
  { q: "Can you build a B2B wholesale portal on Shopify?", a: "Yes, using Shopify Plus or the Shopify B2B features on regular plans. Customer-specific pricing, bulk ordering, purchase order workflows, credit terms, and company-level accounts are all supported." },
  { q: "How is Shopify Plus different from regular Shopify?", a: "Shopify Plus removes transaction fees, allows deeper checkout customization (Checkout Extensibility), supports B2B natively, and includes dedicated support. We recommend it for stores doing ₹50 lakh+ per month in revenue." },
