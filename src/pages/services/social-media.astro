  { q: "Which social media platforms should I be on?", a: "Depends on your business. Instagram and Facebook work for almost every B2C business in Ahmedabad. LinkedIn is essential for B2B services. YouTube Shorts is growing fast for reach. We recommend starting with 2 platforms done well rather than 5 done poorly." },
  { q: "How many posts per month do I get?", a: "Starter: 12 posts across 2 platforms. Growth: 20 posts across 3 platforms plus 4 Reels and Stories. Authority: 30+ posts across all platforms plus video content. All plans include a monthly content calendar submitted for your approval." },
  { q: "Do I need to provide photos and videos?", a: "For most industries, we design static posts using graphics. For Reels and video, we work with your existing footage or shoot concepts you can film easily on your phone. For premium clients, we can arrange professional photo/video shoots." },
  { q: "How do you measure results?", a: "We track reach, impressions, follower growth, engagement rate, link clicks, and DM enquiries. For paid campaigns, we track leads, cost per lead, and ROAS. Every metric is in your monthly report." },
  { q: "Can you run Meta Ads (Facebook / Instagram Ads)?", a: "Yes. Paid social is included in Growth and Authority plans. We handle audience targeting, creative design, ad copy, A/B testing, and daily monitoring. You set the ad budget — we manage the campaigns." },
  { q: "Will the content match our brand voice and visual identity?", a: "Yes — this is non-negotiable for us. We start with a brand audit, document your tone of voice, create a visual template set, and get your approval before publishing anything. Your pages will look and sound consistently like you." },
  { q: "Do you reply to our comments and DMs?", a: "Yes. Community management is included in all plans. We reply to comments and DMs in your brand voice, escalate sales enquiries to you immediately, and manage negative comments professionally." },
  { q: "How long before we see results?", a: "Organic reach and follower growth typically show meaningful results in 60–90 days of consistent posting. Meta Ads can generate leads from week one. We set realistic expectations upfront and share a growth forecast based on your industry benchmarks." },
