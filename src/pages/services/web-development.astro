  { q: "How long does development take?", a: "MVPs take 6–10 weeks. Full business apps take 12–20 weeks. Enterprise platforms are scoped individually. We use 2-week sprints so you see progress continuously." },

  { q: "Can you take over an existing project?", a: "Yes. We frequently rescue abandoned or messy projects. We start with a code audit, create a remediation plan, and take it forward. It costs less than starting over." },
  { q: "Do you work with non-technical founders?", a: "Absolutely — most of our clients are non-technical. We translate your business requirements into technical specs and keep communication jargon-free throughout." },
  { q: "Can you build mobile apps too?", a: "We specialize in web apps that are mobile-responsive. For native iOS/Android apps, we build using React Native, which shares code between platforms and reduces cost." },
  { q: "What happens after launch?", a: "60 days of free post-launch support is included. After that, we offer monthly maintenance retainers or per-request billing. We don't disappear after go-live." },
